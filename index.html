        Purple heart and curly maple, twenty four frets laid into ebony. First
        played on the SS Bay Belle at a Pirates Ball for the Hell’s Angels.
        September 5th, 1973. Over a quarter century had passed since it was last
        played with a band once known as The Warlocks. What was left of the
        living were walking onto the stage at CITI field, it should have been
        Shae Stadium, but we can still think of it that way.<br />
        The summer had wrapped itself around the stadium, holding it close in a
        steamy, altered state. I shielded my eyes as the sun sink in the west,
        and planes made their approach to Laguardia airport. We had just arrived
        from Massachusetts that afternoon. Leaving the latent aggression of
        rural New England behind us, and diving into the wild excesses of New
        York.<br />
        Each parking lot has its own personality. A personality coming from the
        people in it. Where Foxborough had anger percolating just beneath the
        surface, New York was frenetic. Everything all at once with no limits.
        The hiss and pop of balloons filled to bursting with nitrous oxide. So
        many pairs of eyes, vacant and wandering in the heat. I couldn’t help
        but feel that no one should do this. Being so divorced from, or maybe
        conjoined with, a reality more fleeting and powerful than our own.<br />
        I was an observer behind my sunglasses at the spectacular show of
        extravagance on display. There was no goal other than the goal of more,
        more life, maybe. Certainly more of something. Staggering around an
        infernally hot parking lot trying to recapture something of the 70’s.
        What was it about that we wanted to relive?<br />
        It wasn’t more innocent, was it? Did we think the party could go on
        forever? If we just followed them long enough we would find our release.
        If we just took the right dose, at the perfect time. Trusted in Leary
        and Kesey. We shouldn’t still be wandering around on blacktop
        perspiring, being offered a taste to be taken between parked cars. I
        hardly had words for all of the feelings I had. Would we to pass the
        test? Weren’t we supposed to have graduate on Halloween of 1966?<br />
        I was steered to the entrance of the stadium via my elbow like rudder,
        or my rudder like elbow.<br />
        “You were at the show last night? How was it?”<br />
        “It was fantastic.”<br />
        “Well did they play two sets?”<br />
        “Yes. They played everything I wanted to hear.”<br />
        We were cursorily frisked. Security wasn’t looking for what we were
        carrying.<br />
        Seated in the balcony the sun is warm on my chest and face, a breeze
        blows in across the river. The skyline glitters in the evening light. A
        cheer of excitement ripples around the stadium as a Wolf is walked out
        on stage, and St. Stephen rings out.
